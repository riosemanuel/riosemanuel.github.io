# Turning Data Into Revenue Growth

I'm a strategy and analytics leader who helps SaaS companies unlock growth through smarter use of their data. With over 10 years of experience and an engineering background spanning everything from space station hardware testing to revenue operations, I bring a unique problem-solving approach that combines technical precision with business strategy.

## What I Do

I specialize in transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive real results. Whether it's optimizing your go-to-market strategy, building executive dashboards, or implementing AI-driven analytics, I focus on creating solutions that reduce time-to-insight and enable confident decision-making at every level of your organization.

My sweet spot is working with SaaS companies who need rapid deployment of analytics solutions that scale with their growth.

## How I Can Help

**Revenue Analytics & Strategy**
Building comprehensive frameworks that connect your data to revenue outcomes, from customer acquisition through expansion and retention.

**GTM Optimization** 
Streamlining your sales and marketing operations with data-driven insights that accelerate pipeline velocity and improve conversion rates.

**Executive Reporting**
Creating executive-level dashboards and reporting systems that turn data into compelling narratives for C-level decision making.

**Partner Channel Analytics**
Optimizing partner and channel performance through targeted analytics and operational improvements.

## My Approach

I believe the best analytics solutions are the ones that actually get used. That's why I focus on building scalable frameworks that are both technically sound and user-friendly. Every project starts with understanding your specific business challenges and ends with solutions that deliver measurable results.

With Six Sigma certification and an engineering degree from Cornell, I bring methodical precision to every engagement. From technical implementation to business strategy, I help SaaS companies turn their data into their competitive advantage.
