# Turning Data Into Revenue Growth

I'm a strategy and analytics leader who helps SaaS companies unlock growth through smarter use of their data. With 10+ years of experience and an engineering background that spans space station hardware testing to revenue operations, I bring a unique problem-solving approach that blends technical precision with business strategy.

## What I Do

I turn complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive measurable revenue impact. Whether it's:
- Building forecasting models with Â±10% accuracy,
- Implementing AI-powered insights that cut executive prep time by 30%, or
- Conducting analyses that drive 20% resource shifts to high-performing channelsâ€”

My goal is to build solutions that scale with your growth.

I've delivered executive-facing analytics at McKesson ($140B+), Avalara, and Datto, and influenced decisions across sales, marketing, and partner ecosystems. My work bridges strategy and execution, supported by tools like Snowflake, Power BI, and Salesforce, and guided by frameworks grounded in Six Sigma and my MBA from Cornell.

## How I Can Help

**Revenue Analytics & Strategy**  
Linking data to business outcomes across the customer lifecycle.

**GTM Optimization**  
Accelerating pipeline velocity and conversion through operational insights.

**Executive Reporting**  
Turning complex metrics into compelling narratives that inform board-level decisions.

**Partner Channel Analytics**  
Driving partner performance through segmentation, enablement, and strategic analysis.

## My Approach

The best analytics are the ones that get used.

Thatâ€™s why I focus on scalable frameworks that are both technically sound and stakeholder-friendly. I start with your specific GTM challenges and deliver solutions that generate measurable ROI.

With a Six Sigma certification, a Cornell MBA, and a mechanical engineering foundation from Stevens, I bring methodical precision and strategic perspective to every engagement.
